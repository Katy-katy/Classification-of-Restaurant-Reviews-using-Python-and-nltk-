1.Report the accuracy of your classifier on both the development and test data.

DecisionTree classifier:
Accuracy  for development data is  0.50000
Accuracy  for texting data is  0.45000

  
2. Report the confusion matrix generated from your new DecisionTree classifer, 
as well as your NaiveBayes classifer from the previous assignment, given the testing data.
 You do not need to report the confusion matrix for the development data in this file. 
 (To get the confusion matrix for the Naive Bayes classifier, you can pass in to your 
 program the baseline-classifier.pickle that you created in Assignment 3.)
