# Classification of Restaurant Reviews using Python and nltk

It is an assignment for "Introduction to Natural Language Processing" class at University of California Santa Cruz

My goal was to predict the Category (positive or negative) of restaurant reviews using nltk library and machine learning algorithms (NaiveBayesClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier)

restaurant-competition-P2_train.py file was using to train the algorithm. The algorithm was save in restaurant-competition-model-P2.pickle

Then I used restaurant-competition-P2.py to predict the result for testing data

I got accuracy 0.83 using Naive Bayes classifier and only 32 best features.

My grade is 9.8	(max 10.0) and I get a comment from my instructor "In all, an excellent job!"
