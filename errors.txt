("Outstanding!! First time in many months that eating out was a wonderful experience. Wait staff was courteous, knowledgable, efficient. Cream of carrot soup doesn't sound very exciting, however, the offering was fantastic. I never knew that carrots could make soup sooo good. Accompanied by feshly baked knotted dough rolls, soft center with a nice crust and smattered with the right amount of garlic and olive oil to awaken the senses. The Chicken Amaretto over linguine was fantastic as the experience continued to satisfy. Chicken isn't supposed to taste this good! To finsih the experience the canoli and espresso was awesome.

('Okay, heres the deal...I moved here about 4 years ago and the was told to visit Tunni\'s ASAP. I did, and boy, was it fun! Every night the local hill residents made their way to this place for conversation, drinks and AMAZING food. The owner at the time, Current executive director of the washington restaurant association, Lynne Breaux, was always smiling and welcoming friends/ guests along with her popular charismatic staff. This place was the "Cheers" of Capitol Hill. It is unfortunate that the new owner or new general manager is not more aware of how they have damaged the Eastern Market scene by dulling and sterilizing this historic place. All notion of fun is GONE! 4 years ago when you walked through those doors on ANY given night there would be people playing cards, discussing politics, discussing bargains they found that weekend at the market, announcing engagements, etc. Local soccer leagues ( adult and youth) would be celebrating their wins or losses, and there was always a general feeling of community. Today....I wasnt sure if it was alright to speak at all, and no one was celebrating anything! Well, what was is gone and in the past but I cant help but wonder how an establishment that provided so many generations of Washingtonians and newcomers alike such a welcoming gathering place to meet and wind down, became the very place I dont want to ever go again...i wonder if they know that the experience isnt even a quarter of what it used to be, and that for the price of a single brunch I could walk across the street and buy the goods myself and feed a group.

('I went to the Villa Tronco with a group of friends. I am a college student at USC, as are they. It was a friend\'s birthday dinner. There were seven of us. I understand that reservations were made for eight. The food is fairly expensive, although, not unreasonable for a small Italian restaurant located in the city. I was in the mood for pasta and a number of us were watching our wallets. Most of us ended up ordering the same or similar dishes. The salad arrived. Although it was small, it was fine with a light lemony dressing. The taste and freshness whetted us for the entree. Our drinks were not full, our waitress had no personality, she never checked on us, or came to ask us how we were--all the usual things that wait staff does. The entrees arrived. The food was awful. I almost sent mine back on the spot but decided against it because I didn\'t want to detract from the birthday spirit. I should have sent it back. The pasta although not mushy was waterlogged, incredibly bland, and probably wasn\'t even semolina. I had a combination plate hoping that I could sample some delicious ravioli, lasagna, and rigatoni in their respective sauces. The tomato sauce was a diluted tomato puree that certainly lacked tomato flavor and had no herbs or spice. None. The lasagna had no flavor, and I could not bring myself to eat it with its mushy blobs of browned hamburger (not likely that it was even ground chuck). The cream sauce on the rigatoni was light and pleasant even if the pasta itself was anything but. The garnish was a sprinkle of parsley that was in the cream sauce on the rigatoni. So it wasn\'t actually garnish. The presentation on-the-whole was awful. It looked like a cafeteria plate. My friend had the eggplant parmesan of which she could only eat half although she hadn\'t eaten. She paid so much for it that she took the other half of the miniscule portion home and ate it this morning as breakfast because of monetary guilt and spite. Another friend of mine described her food as "gross" with "watery tomato" from a can. Another offered her sympathy because she didn\'t have the meatballs to "break it up." I think you get the picture. Fortunately, the birthday girl enjoyed her dish that was some $20-something dollar creation. I would gladly have paid a little more if only I had known. I planned to speak to the manager to express my displeasure, but had every intention of paying (and none of tipping). Our checks came. Gratuity had been added. Our party of seven were seated in separate booths, served at different times. The gratuity was a surprise and a shock. The 20% addition to the bill unjustified. One of the checks was calculated wrong. I spoke to manager and asked the gratuity be removed. It was minor, but it was at least $3.00 on our checks. It would have made us more content. I explained the lack of presentation, the waitress who gave us no attention, the empty drinks, the bad food, the server who asked "Who had the eggplant parm?" I explained that we weren\'t served as a party or seated as one. I got nowhere. I was told more or less that we had been done a favor by getting reservations because they were busy. There were at least three empty booths immediately surrounding us. There was no bustle, no wait, no one eating. I was told that whoever made the reservations understood the arrangement. I told them that they had expected we would have been served together. I explained the entire party\'s discontent and disappointment. Surely, reservations are not a contract that says the diners must be pleased with the dining and service. I was told that because my friend had gotten a free piece of cheesecake I was in no place to complain. And lastly, I was told that I had an excellent waitress. I thought about causing a seen but could see that Carmella (the manager) was likely to escalate the situation to something inappropriate. We were forced to tip the bad waitress, given no respect as costumers, given no compensation for our discontent, and made to pay for slop that any fast food chain could produce if they went Italian. I have had poor dishes, but this amount of disrespect is new.

('The Coral Grill has been a landmark of the Florida Key\'s since the early 60\'s, known for it\'s huge, fresh and bountiful seafood buffet; it was very popular with locals and vacationers alike. Over the years the management / owners had switched hands several times and unfortunately every time there was a changing of the guard the quality of the food and service suffered. The Coral Grill was untimely the final owners drove the restaurant to the ground which lead to the closing of it\'s doors. For several years one would drive by and see the huge "Coral Grill" sign wishing that it would re-open. Then unexpectedly there was activity within the building and to our surprise the restaurant re-opened with a fourth installment of new management. We had hoped that the extended years of hibernation of the Coral Grill meant that perhaps someone who remember what the Coral Grill used to be famous for and perhaps would once again bring this "world famous" restaurant back to it\'s original grandeur. We decided to give her a try\x85 Unfortunately the Coral Grill is only but a miniscule representation of it\'s former self. Yes, the buffet is back but in a very, very small scale. The upstairs dinning room is still closed and the limited buffet is now in a room where "lunch" used to be served. Very depressing for those who used to wait an hour or more for a table to be rewarded for waiting by mountains of fresh seafood, mouth watering prime rib and a desert selection to die for. There were no lines and we got a seat immediately, which should have been a warning of what was to come. A rather attractive blond haired woman served us, however her attitude and customer service skills needed some major improvement. She acted as if we were bothering her, even more surprising when we noticed that the dining room was filled to about a fourth of it\'s capacity. The food, although of very limited quantity, was not bad. The prime rib was very tasty and the crab legs appeared fresh. Other items seemed picked over; the soups were watery and needed some more seasoning. Crab cakes, one of their specialties of days old, were not even close to what we remember. Salad bar was out of greens and the desert bar was populated with small pieces of some cake like substance, jello and what looked like ambrosia salad. If the price was about half of what we paid, I would have considered the meal almost expectable. But for what the Coral Grill is currently charging per person, there are far better seafood buffets, one of them is right across the street at the Whale Harbor Inn. It\'s a shame that the new owners seemed to think that people will flock to the restaurant based on it\'s name alone. What they failed to realize that people remember the food, the quantity and the quality, that\'s what brings them back.

("Delancey Street is unique in that it is staffed completely by recovering drug addicts, alcoholics, and ex-convicts, who work in exchange for rehabilitation services and housing in the Delancey Street Foundation complex within which the restaurant is located. Opened in 1991 in a deserted area south of the Bay Bridge, it's now in the heart of what has become the upscale neighborhood known as South Beach. When eating here, you can feel good about supporting the organization's mission and helping your less fortunate fellow man, while at the same time enjoying one of San Francisco's finest dining experiences. The slightly austere but attractive interior is decorated with generous displays of fresh produce and flowers, and the large windows overlooking the Embarcadero offer a perfect view of the nearby bridge. There's a small outdoor patio used whenever the weather allows (summer nights here can be foggy and damp). Perhaps because they want to prove themselves capable, or possibly because their self-esteem has been bolstered by the benefits of the program, every wait person is friendly, attentive, and genuinely eager to please. The staffs at many of the city's high class dining spots could learn a lesson or two from these servers. In a word, the food preparation here is impeccable. I have eaten here at least a dozen times, have always ordered something different, and have never been disappointed with my choice. The menu is eclectic, offering samples of home cooking from around the world. Selections are as diverse as Yankee Pot Roast, Thai Red Curry Prawns, Caribbean Grilled Chicken Breast with Mango Sauce, and Moroccan Chicken. Some of the best food is from the grill or rotisserie, including loin of pork, leg of lamb, and a huge slab of rare beef crusted in black peppercorns and a natural juice that moistens the huge pile of garlic mashed potatoes on which it rests. Equally good are the barbecued chicken and baby back ribs combination and the spit-roasted rosemary chicken. There's also a selection of pastas, the best of which is a highly spiced version of Penne Arrabbiata. The Spinach Salad is a great starter; if you have the room, any one of the desserts is a treat. Amazingly, the huge portions don't command hefty prices - most entrees are less than $15.00, and chances are you'll leave with a doggie bag containing enough for a second meal. Beer and wine are available. As with all areas of San Francisco, street parking is very difficult, but public transportation here is not a viable option. Open for lunch 11:00am - 3:00pm Tuesday-Friday; dinner 5:30 - 11:00pm Tuesday - Sunday; brunch from 10:00am - 5:30pm Saturday and Sunday. Reservations are recommended.

('Ironic, but it\'s not easy to find traditional Tahitian cuisine (ma\'a) in Tahiti. The big hotels offer their Polynesian Night feasts but other than that, where are the little Tahitian restaurants where one can get breadfruit (uru), taro, red banana and other specialities that I crave when in Polynesia? It\'s true that "you haven\'t really been there until you\'ve eaten the food" so I need to find a place where the locals go! On the island of Moorea, Chez Capo fulfills my obsession with Tahitian cuisine. The retaurant in Haapiti is a tiny thatched-roof bistro under a great breadfruit tree. Just off the main road, you see chickens wandering around the yard and local residents going about their daily business and you KNOW you are finally in Tahiti! The food at Chez Capo reflects the essence of Tahitian culture with offerings of mahi-mahi in vanilla sauce, shrimp in coconut milk, tender goat curry. The poisson cru (a national dish of marinated raw fish) is served up in large portions with french bread for dipping the sauce. I loved the crispy uru (breadfruit) chips served complimentary with each meal and the baked uru, taro, plaintain and red banana that accompanied each plate. Chez Capo has become "our place" for traditional Tahitian food when we\'re in Haapiti, Moorea. Joe loves the uru and banana chips as a "take out" snack while walking the nearby beach. The staff at Chez Capo is "family" and the atmosphere is the idyllic little beach cafe on a tropical island in a novel you may have read.

Right after the wine was opened and the appetizers delivered a woman came to the table and started clearing the seats that were for the rest of our party. Only when we asked what she was doing did she rudely say she was clearing the table because our guests didn't show up and they needed to seat the table (mind you we already had food ordered and sitting on this table). We were told that we could all shove ourselves around a table meant for 3 people. We tried to fit the chairs and the high chair around the small table but it would not work at which time we asked for the bill. If the restaurant had a policy of not seating a party until everyone was there, they should have said so. If they choose to break their rule then they should stick by their decision. It was THE WORST I've ever been treated at a restaurant and left me with the impression they only cared about getting as much money as they could. Money over customer satisfaction. Bad - bad - bad! We took our whole party over to Horsefeathers and had one of the best nights of our life. Needless to say we had a rather large dining bill and were more than happy to leave a very large tip for the waiter - too bad Bellini's missed out.", ['several', 'friends', 'went', 'north', 'conway', 'visit', 'collegue', 'lives', 'along', '9', 'month', 'old', 'baby', 'got', 'restaurant', 'first', 'asked', 'could', 'seated', 'remainder', 'party', 'delayed', '15', 'minutes', 'meantime', 'ordered', 'wine', 'appetizers', 'whole', 'table', '6', 'us', 'right', 'wine', 'opened', 'appetizers', 'delivered', 'woman', 'came', 'table', 'started', 'clearing', 'seats', 'rest', 'party', 'asked', 'rudely', 'say', 'clearing', 'table', 'guests', "n't", 'show', 'needed', 'seat', 'table', 'mind', 'already', 'food', 'ordered', 'sitting', 'table', 'told', 'could', 'shove', 'around', 'table', 'meant', '3', 'people', 'tried', 'fit', 'chairs', 'high', 'chair', 'around', 'small', 'table', 'would', 'work', 'time', 'asked', 'bill', 'restaurant', 'policy', 'seating', 'party', 'everyone', 'said', 'choose', 'break', 'rule', 'stick', 'decision', 'worst', "'ve", 'ever', 'treated', 'restaurant', 'left', 'impression', 'cared', 'getting', 'much', 'money', 'could', 'money', 'customer', 'satisfaction', 'bad', 'bad', 'bad', 'took', 'whole', 'party', 'horsefeathers', 'one', 'best', 'nights', 'life', 'needless', 'say', 'rather', 'large', 'dining', 'bill', 'happy', 'leave', 'large', 'tip', 'waiter', 'bad', 'bellini', "'s", 'missed'], 'negative')

('HELP! if someone sees this within the Bowie area, please I could just scream, I just have to let you know. I had an aweful experience. I decided, since it was Holiday, to treat some of the younger generation within my family, to a nice meal, and a movie. The movie "Maid In Heaven" was very good! However, prior to that we went over to the TGIF within the Town Center. 1. We waited 10 minutes, after being seated, before I asked for our server. 2. We received no water! 3. So naturally, the hostess that I am, I allowed my guess to order what they wanted. They chose the hi-ended items. 4. Finally we met our server, and, he apologized, explaining that they were in the back figuring out who was going to serve who. 5. Dah!!! TMI - too much info, I don\'t want to know that. 6. I want to be served. I explained that we were going to the movies across the lot. I ordered soup, I got no spoon! 7. The soup came with my entree, however, it was just liquid. 8. I returned it asking for a better serving, It was luke warm. 9. All the entrees ordered were either burned, or cooked twice. 10. It was awful. I displayed it all to the manager, and he gave me a DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, HE SHOULD HAVE WAIVED THE ENTIRE MEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I\'m over with that CHAIN for a while. I was embarrased, it was supposed to be a treat. My guess were not impressed, and it reflected BAD on part, for making such a selection to dine in. :-( vthomas4513@yahoo.com', ['help', 'someone', 'sees', 'within', 'bowie', 'area', 'please', 'could', 'scream', 'let', 'know', 'aweful', 'experience', 'decided', 'since', 'holiday', 'treat', 'younger', 'generation', 'within', 'family', 'nice', 'meal', 'movie', 'movie', 'maid', 'heaven', 'good', 'however', 'prior', 'went', 'tgif', 'within', 'town', 'center', '1', 'waited', '10', 'minutes', 'seated', 'asked', 'server', '2', 'received', 'water', '3', 'naturally', 'hostess', 'allowed', 'guess', 'order', 'wanted', 'chose', 'hi-ended', 'items', '4', 'finally', 'met', 'server', 'apologized', 'explaining', 'back', 'figuring', 'going', 'serve', '5', 'dah', 'tmi', 'much', 'info', "n't", 'want', 'know', '6', 'want', 'served', 'explained', 'going', 'movies', 'across', 'lot', 'ordered', 'soup', 'got', 'spoon', '7', 'soup', 'came', 'entree', 'however', 'liquid', '8', 'returned', 'asking', 'better', 'serving', 'luke', 'warm', '9', 'entrees', 'ordered', 'either', 'burned', 'cooked', 'twice', '10', 'awful', 'displayed', 'manager', 'gave', 'discount', 'waived', 'entire', 'meal', "'m", 'chain', 'embarrased', 'supposed', 'treat', 'guess', 'impressed', 'reflected', 'bad', 'part', 'making', 'selection', 'dine', 'vthomas4513', 'yahoo.com'], 'negative')

("Gigantic Green Sugar Snap Peas, Peppers and Pears adorn the outside walls of this Modern American Cafe. As you step inside, bursts of Orange, Tangerine, Red and Purple rest on your eyes; the aroma from the wide open kitchen right in front of you plays with your sense of smell and you begin to salivate and your appetite aroused. An inviting scene of chefs in action, steam coming from the stove, masterpieces laid out on the counter. Then the host ignores you and your back to reality. A bit of a turn off to start your evening, especially if you are a stickler for good and sincere service. We are seated on tapestry-like covered sofas, and get a glimpse of the mural on the back wall with colorful and once again gigantic fruits and vegetables. Sunflower seed crusted bread and sweet potato spread is brought to our table, YUM! This renders you a peak into the eclectic menu ahead of you. Thyme square is known for using organic ingredients and serving creative vegetarian and vegan choices. These dishes, often updated between seasons, are so full of flavor and have generous proportions that you won't go missing the beef, chicken or fish! They do offer meat and fish selections such as this wonderful dish of organic Sirloin from Ridgefield Farms in New York, finished with Bordelaise sauce & shallots, buttery mashed Yukon Golds, and vibrant green sauteed spinach; definitely worth a trip to downtown Bethesda. They also have chicken, halibut, salmon, to name a few. The Moroccan Couscous dish is a must for first timers! Our meal started off with soup; I had the Charred Tomato & Tortilla Soup ($5.95) and Hubby had the Wild Mushroom & Leek Soup with a Chevre Crostini\x97a must to compliment this flavorful soup! ($5.95) I'd had the mushroom soup before, and my memory was still intact and they still made it as delicious as years ago! These are the only two selections for soup\x97after you've tasted them, you'll realize it's more than enough. Our entrees: the Brazilian Shellfish Stew in a spicy Tomato-Coconut Curry Sauce with Basmati Rice and Fried Plantain Strips as garnish ($19.95). Spectacular! The shrimp, mussels, salmon, scallops (these depend on what is fresh and available) were tender and not overpowered by the sauce, in fact the natural flavors of each were brought out by the \x91clean', fresh broth, and contributed to complexity of the entire dish. Kudos to the Chef! I had the Pistachio-Crusted Tuna on a Bed of Garlic Sauteed Spinach and Crowned with Fresh Watercress ($19.95). To die for! I have a bias for tuna, and this tops my list. I asked for medium rare, and it created a perfectly seared border around the pinkish flesh. No starch for this dish and rightly so! Some negatives: Service through the meal was at best mediocre, not as attentive as we would have liked. I also have to mention that their restrooms are not kept well. Be wary of their version of Pad Thai and Quesadillas\x97not their best. Price is on the expensive side so save this for something special. Overall, the experience was gastronomic bliss, thus making us forget the rude host in front.

('We heard about the hype of this place, and were told that, for a French, this was the place to be - OUCH! Pastries were hard and raw, apparently from hours earlier. So-called "Douce France" doesn\'t give locals anything French nor sweet as the name suggests. Another tourist trap to me. Also we went to observe a French conversation group - meeting every Friday night. These looked like people avid of all-French things - but they obviously don\'t eat pastries :-)', ['heard', 'hype', 'place', 'told', 'french', 'place', 'ouch', 'pastries', 'hard', 'raw', 'apparently', 'hours', 'earlier', 'so-called', 'douce', 'france', "n't", 'give', 'locals', 'anything', 'french', 'sweet', 'name', 'suggests', 'another', 'tourist', 'trap', 'also', 'went', 'observe', 'french', 'conversation', 'group', 'meeting', 'every', 'friday', 'night', 'looked', 'like', 'people', 'avid', 'all-french', 'things', 'obviously', "n't", 'eat', 'pastries'], 'negative')

("A sleeper of a restaurant, World Grill offers not only great food, but superb, personable service in an elegant setting. With choices ranging from fresh pasta with langostinos sauteed in garlic and basil, to my personal favorite, roast duck in a sweet fig sauce served over red cabbage and mashed potatoes to the World Grill Platter, a sampler of crab cakes, gulf shrimp and filet mignon, they have something for everyone. The menu selections can vary by season. You will start with fresh bread with strawberry butter. Be sure to try the appetizers and leave room for the oversized deserts. There is a large wine selection, both local and imports as well a treat for the vodka lovers, at least 40 different varieties and flavors to choose from. Definitely worth the trip! You wont leave hungry. Also, be sure to try the lunch buffet.

('Reservations are almost always required to get a spot on a Friday or Saturday evening. Always seated in a timely manner if arriving at reservation time. Initial greeting by server usually takes a bit longer than I\'d prefer and it seems to be that way most times I go. It\'s hard to say whether or not the "long" wait times for server and food are intentional so their patrons do not feel rushed in any way. It is a BYOB establishment and I usually bring a bottle of wine that the waitstaff tends to promptly. Food is excellent but takes a while longer to receive than most places. Pricing is a bit on the expensive side but I\'d say the food and experience are definitely worth it. The only thing they could do to improve my visits could be to speed up service and food delivery just a bit. Overall, it\'s a hard place to beat for an authentic cajun meal in a quaint, new orleans, mardi gras(ish) environment.
